Starting this lab, we have to configure our web server. I'm using CentOS, where I can use nmtui or some equivalent.
If starting fresh, remember to make a sudo user by making the user and adding usermod -aG wheel yourname.
After ensuring the OS is set up properly, run sudo yum install httpd. This installs the web server package.
Next, run sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http or https, and reload the firewall. This allows Apache to allow http or https connections (can be both!)
Start the web server with sudo systemctl start httpd and check status with sudo systemctl status httpd. You should find it running from that.
To actually edit the page you've made, delete welcome.conf and create an html. I did sudo echo "This is deeeefinitely not a test. -John" > /var/www/html/index.html.
/var/www/html is the path to any html you make.
