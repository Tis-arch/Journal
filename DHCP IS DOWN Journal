So in this lab I effectively learned how to make a DHCP on the Active Directory.
Firstly, you need to download (via the Add Roles and Features) the DHCP Server, Remote Server Administration Tools, and the DHCP Server tools.
Make sure to set them up for the FS01 server.
In the DHCP, right click IPv4 and add a new scope. Insert the necessary settings.
Release and renew on your workstation.
IF YOU GET A PRIVATE IP NOT IN THE RANGE THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO DELETE AND MAKE THE SCOPE AGAIN (that's what fixed it for me anyway).
