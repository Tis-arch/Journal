Firstly you gotta make sure you have new users, made using the root account. useradd name and passwd name.
Use a strong password generator for the passwords. Make a log of the passwords somewhere secure, and encrypt the file or keep it away from any networks.
To create groups to add them to, use groupadd name.
Add them using usermod -aG groupname username.
MAKE DIRECTORIES FOR EACH GROUP MADE.
