Firstly you gotta make sure you have new users, made using the root account. useradd name and passwd name.
Use a strong password generator for the passwords. Make a log of the passwords somewhere secure, and encrypt the file or keep it away from any networks.
To create groups to add them to, use groupadd name.
Add them using usermod -aG groupname username.
MAKE DIRECTORIES FOR EACH GROUP MADE.
Use chgrp directory to make a directory modifiable by a group.
Chmod works like this. x-yyy, x can be u for user, g for group, or o for other. y can be r for read, w for write and x for execute.
