Read previous Lab notes before doing anything here
We've started to use the Server, noted as ad01. The base settings are fine but change the network to the LAN and make sure the firewall is running.
After server manager is invoked, set the ipv4 settings to the following: 
IP Address:  10.0.5.5
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway 10.0.5.2
DNS 10.0.5.2
(The gateway and DNS are both in the same location.)
Rename, Reboot.
In server roles, give yourself ADDS. ADDS allows us full control over data management and anyone on our network.
ADDS should work as long as we're connected to a DNS. If we're somehow NOT connected to one, there's a pretty major issue already.
DNS Zones must then be created in the DNS manager, for both the firewall and the active directory.
Add user to domain admin group, allowing remote management of the domain.
Somewhere between the last lab and this one, the workstation changed and there's no network connection. I've tested what the problem could be extensively aside from the fact that it's failing to resolve and got nowhere so far.

Major Definitions:
DNS: Known as the Domain Name System, it's what connects computers to IPs through networks and multiple links
ADDS: Known as the Active Directory Domain Services a server role in Active Directory that allows admins to manage and store information about resources from a network.
TLD A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet.

This is important: Anytime you have a new system that needs to join the domain, it needs to refer to the domainâ€™s DNS server.
