We've started to use the Server, noted as ad01. The base settings are fine but change the network to the LAN and make sure the firewall is running.
After server manager is invoked, set the ipv4 settings to the following: 
IP Address:  10.0.5.5
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway 10.0.5.2
DNS 10.0.5.2
(The gateway and DNS are both in the same location.)
Rename, Reboot.
In server roles, give yourself ADDS. ADDS allows us full control over data management and anyone on our network.
ADDS should work as long as we're connected to a DNS. If we're somehow NOT connected to one, there's a pretty major issue already.
