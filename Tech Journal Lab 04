Firstly, I downloaded PuTTY on my AD01 computer. I had to first disable IE ESC via the Local Server settings. I personally use this over Powershell because I've had multiple problems with it in the past, but none with PuTTY.
Using sudo yum install dhcp, we install... dhcp.
Open the config file in nano, default directory is /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
Assign subnet, netmask, gateways and the like. If you don't know what you wanna config to already, use the man page.
Use systemctl start dhcpd as root to start the DHCP.
Next, we gotta configure the firewall to allow IMCP and SSH requests.
To see what we need to add, invoke firewall-cmd --list-all.
Always add --permanent to ensure you save changes.
Add the DHCP to the services using firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp -- permanent.
Reload using firewall cmd--reload to ensure it goes through.
Bring the list up one more time, to make sure it's there.
We changed to a static IP earlier, time to change that. In workstation, to make sure it works, set your IPs to automatic.
If all goes well, check ipconfig /all and make sure there's a listing that says DCHP Servers.
