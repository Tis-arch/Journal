For this lab, we're making a new OU structure for our AD.
Under ADDS> Users and Computers, we can make our own organizational units.
We can easily create new users in our new groups, as well as add new devices and groups for users depending on what clearance they have.
We can then modify these group policies via ADDS > Tools > Group Policy Management.
One should increase the security of these policies (more complex passwords, expiration dates, etc.)
  Weak admin policies are more convenient but are a huge breach danger.
Here, we can create a GPO by navigating to our new folder for this lab (or whatever folder you use).
Since we want only computers on our domain to do things, we should remove authenticicated users and add the Domain Computers group.
We can also edit the settings. COMPUTER settings are applied when workstations turn on, where USER settings apply when users login.
