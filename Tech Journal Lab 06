With this new FS01, we gotta immediately connect it to the LAN.
After making our info, we need to use sconfig.
Edit the network settings to whatever you want before you even think trying to join the domain.
Next, we move to AD. Download the feature. Under the add roles and features, select features. Go for the following.
Remote Server Administration Tools > AD DS and AD LDS Tools > File Services Tools (cuz file services server) > File Server Resource Manager Tools
This will allow you to modify the file server via the AD.
Then, you must add it via the add server option by right clicking all servers. Search the server name and connect it.
While I am doing my own assignment, you can use netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”Remote File Server Resource Manager Management” new enable=yes to remotely set rules on the file server.
